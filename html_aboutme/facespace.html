		<p>Hello, I'm Chelsea! I'm a pop culture nut, Ravenclaw, and lover of all animals(especially my cats).<br> I run a few fanpages with my sister, but my first and most popular one is "Sherlock, The Mess You've Made"; we have over 20 thousand likes and 16 admins.<br> I'm part of an online community as well with over 30 people from all over the world. It started out as an admin contest for my one of my fan pages but we all fell in love with each other so we made a chat to keep in touch- That was more than a year ago and we're still going strong!</p>
