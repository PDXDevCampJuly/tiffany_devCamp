		<div align="center"> <h1>A Night Vale PSA</h1>

		<p>The Night Vale Psychological Association recommends that you spend at least 30 minutes each day believing what you see. The NVPA cited a study showing that more than 60% of all working citizens live in a self-created dome of obstinance, distraction, and surreal fantasy. When confronted with actual things outside of their own understanding – referred to by the psychologists as “real life” – most test subjects closed their eyes and pretend there was a spider or something on the ground.</p>

		<p>The study does warn that trusting your own eyes can lead to some dangers. For instance: poltergeists, robots, and humidity may create visual illusions, tricking you into unsavory activities like gambling, and eating non-foods, so that they can gloat at your misfortune.
		But the NVPA assures us that taking what you see at face value, even if only for a few minutes daily, is the most efficient way to live. It saves the mind from the emotional stress of self-fiction and skepticism.  </p>

		<p>The NVPA statement adds that “you look good in that shirt, and that you should wear tighter clothing. People want to see what you look like under there!” They also ask you to just touch their back. “You don’t have to rub it. Just touch it. Just put your hand…there. God, I miss you so much!” the report concludes.</p>
