			<p>Steven Universe is a family friendly show that manages to be adult while staying simple enough that even - especially - a kid can understand and enjoy it. It talks about honest as more then a bianary issue, touches on personal betrayal and then neither demonizes anyone nor sweeps it under the rug, and make relationships front and center.</p>
			<p>But what is it that makes this show so great? There are several things going for it that deserve attention.</p>

				<h3>It's actually feminist, without any fake feminist misandry:</h3>
				<img src="tumblr_nr8ciiaSgh1s3zkxko1_540.jpg" alt="Rock and roll Rose." width="30%" align="right">
				<p>Women and men are both allowed to be strong, but the show is willing to show many different kinds of strength. It avoids saying "This is what it means to be Strong, Able." Greg Universe is both a broken man, and a strong man standing up and supporting a son he doesn't understand. Garnet, the strongest of the Gems, has glaring weaknesses that grow organically from her character. Pearl can be both together and a mess in the same breath.</p>
				<p>There's a tendence for relationships to define in what ways a character is strong and weak, and once you know the 'code' it's easy to read the characters by it, but that isn't exactly a flaw so much as a style.</p>

				<h3>It has a mythic underpinning</h3>
				<p>While the in medias res start is both a little awkward, silly, and jaring, the show has a story to tell, one spanning thousends of years, with dead gods, ancient sins, and a war that never really ended. The story has enough happening <b><i>now</i></b> to keep your kids happy, and enough depth that you'll be scraching away at the mystery behind the characters actions for some time. The story starts in the fantastic, moves to the mundane, then ties that back into its myths and stories. Not sense Avatar: The Last Airbender has a kids story worked so hard to build a satisfying story for the parents.</p>
				<p>Even elements that seem insignificant can suddenly become important, which makes it more fun as you go over old episodes looking for missed hints.</p>

				<h3>In the end, the characters victories and pains become yours</h3>
				<p>You like the characters, and sympathize with them. That's key.</p>
