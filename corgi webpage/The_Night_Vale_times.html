		<p>Listeners, a new traveler has arrived in Night Vale. This is not uncommon, perfectly located as we are between several vertices, but this Traveler is not one who will be mistaken for those other travelers – you know the ones</p>

		<p>This Traveler is said to have a foreign face and a handsome, but terrible, beard. He is reportedly wearing a uniform with silver epaulets, golden braid, and buttons of a metallic alloy not describable in our limited color language. This is all very similar to the marching band uniform of the Desert Bluffs Cacti prior to The Incident, but The Traveler’s uniform is not scorched and soaked with blood.</p>

		<blockquote>“I cannot say that I trust this interloper very much, and his actions do not give me reasons to trust him,”</blockquote>
		 <p>suggests the Manual on Interlopers, published by the Sheriff’s Secret Police. According to the manual, citizens are advised to not speak with The Traveler, and to dig a shelter in their garden. Or, if they do not have a garden, to make themselves into a metaphorical shelter through vigilance and a positive outlook. </p>

		<p>Who can say what agenda The Traveler might have? He drives a large and expensive truck, he digs in the desert late at night, he does not seem adequately respectful of Forbidden Areas, and he has already married Night Vale’s third most beautiful woman: Cactus June. He persuaded her to come down from her cactus, and he has married her. I am looking at a photograph of the wedding in the newspaper at this very moment. Now, I am drinking something. [slurps] Now, I am eating an enchilada [mumbles with mouth full] that was just handed to me.</p>

		<p>Mayor Pamela Winchell called an emergency press conference today, her fourth this week. After the usual crowd had gathered around, minus those arrested at previous press conferences, she began proceedings by vibrating slightly and staring at the sun for five straight minutes. Once these usual pleasantries were over she read her statement, which was the following:<br>“The fences in the caves. A heart throbbing for what it cannot have. A heart not having what it needs to throb. The fences in the caves. Heat from below and above, but all is cold betwixt. The fences in the caves. The fences in the caves.”<br> Then she vanished in a puff of green smoke. </p>

		<p>Several follow-up questions were asked, but since no one was at the podium, none of them were answered. Many of the questions were rhetorical anyway. After the round of questioning, a few arrests were made, and the chosen journalists were led away to wherever journalists are taken when they disappear forever.<br> All in all, a relatively uneventful press conference.
