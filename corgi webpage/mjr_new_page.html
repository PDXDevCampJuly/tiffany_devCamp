    <h2>How to take photos with your Leica</h2>
        <p>Taking a photo with a rangefinder of your pets is even easier than using your SLR camera. This is due to the fact that you're able to see what's happening the instant your shutter is fired. You'll be able to tell if you've managed to capture the perfect Corgi moment.</p>
        <p>As provided suggested by Tiffnay they are <a href="corgi_outline.html">taking over the interwebs, and cats are losing favor.</a></p>
    <h2>Why Rangefinders? By Anthony Chang</h2>
    <p>Today we have a guest piece by Anthony Chang discussing his reasons for choosing a rangefinder.</p>
    <p>Why do I like using rangefinders so much, a question I’m often asked by my peers and fellow photographers. Now before I say anything this isn’t a article about me telling you that you should all switch to using rangefinders and that they’re better then SLRs, because they really aren’t.</p>
    <p>Being able to take a good photo was never about the tools you use its about how you use them. As odd as it is coming from me, an all round gear whore who keeps buying new toys whenever I have any spare cash on hand, you must never think that you’ll get better photos if you had this camera or this lens. Thats the number one mistake any new photographer makes, if you look around you’ll find people who use point and shoots to an entry level DSLR with a kit lens being able to take better photos then a lot of the rich folks who have enough money to buy the most expensive equipment money can buy. I still use my SLRs quite often but I enjoy using my rangefinders a lot more.</p>
    <p>I’m more or less going to talk about the pros and cons of using rangefinders along with some of my personal opinions about them. And I guess I should explain what exactly makes them different from SLRs for the people who don’t really know what a rangefinder is. So as usual take everything I say with a grain of salt because nothing is set in stone around here. Its just the ramblings of a young asian photographer who likes to think he knows a thing or two about photography.</p>
