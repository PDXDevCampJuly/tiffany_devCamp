    <h2>How to take photos with your Leica</h2>
        <p>Taking a photo with a rangefinder of your pets is even easier than using your SLR camera. This is due to the fact that you're able to see what's happening the instant your shutter is fired. You'll be able to tell if you've managed to capture the perfect Corgi moment.</p>
